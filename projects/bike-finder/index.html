				<h1>Quick Cycle Bike Finder<br><span class="date">2018</span></h1>
				<p>Quick Cycle is a fictional online bike retailer whose audience ranges from buyers with little to no bike knowledge, to those with expertise. I designed the website to function as the perfect bike finder for anyone who visits Quick Cycle. The project largely entailed of user research and prototyping; branding and the customer review elements were not a part of this assignment.</p>

				<h3>PROCESS</h3>
				<h4>Observation and Gaining Product Knowledge</h4>
				<p style="margin-top:10px">My user research process began with becoming the user myself, tracking my own journey of buying a bike online. The two set of search keywords I used on Google's search engine were "where to buy a bike" and "bike shop online." I had very little knowledge on bikes at the time. The most important takeaways from my observation was that as a user, I valued <em>familiar brands, product description, reviews and ratings from other customers, and comprehensibility of product details.</em> 
				<br><br>
				After familiarizing myself with the process of buying a bike online, I expanded my product knowledge by learning about different types of bikes, bike sizes, what people look for when buying new bikes, etc. 
				</p>
				
				<h4>Building Personas and User Stories</h4>
				<p style="margin-top:10px">Next step was creating a persona as a team. There were 6 teams in the class, thus ultimately 6 different personas. My team crafted a persona named Clair, whose description could be found below along with the rest of them.</p>
				<img src="images/process_persona.png">
				<br><br>
				<p style="margin-top:10px">Using Clair, I broke the purchasing process down into a series of small, discrete objectives, following the User Story pattern: "As a &#60; type of user &#62;, I want &#60; some goal &#62; so that &#60; some reason &#62;." In the end, the 6 teams compiled the user stories of each persona together into a document that could be used as a base for the user experience design on Quick Cycle's website.
				<p class="accordion" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:10px; color:white;">Expand User Stories Sample</p>
					<div class="userstory">
						<ul style="font-weight:300; font-style:italic">
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want my bike to be a mountain bike so that I could be more involved in another outdoor activity.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want to shop at a brand that is well known so that I can be assured of the quality of the product I will be purchasing.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want my bike to perform smoothly on trails so that I can have my dog along with me when I ride.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want my bike to have high endurance level so that I can challenge myself on the trails.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want my bike to sort the options by price, costing less than $3,000 so that I can browse through options that are high quality enough for me, but not getting too much into the professional level.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want to compare the different technological features employed in my options so that I can see which features I need for my bike.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want to carefully read the descriptions on my bike options so that I can find a bike that will allow me to expand my experience in the outdoor activity.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want to read through the reviews on each product so that I can once again be assured of the sucessfulness of my bike.</li>
							<li>&#8226;As Clair, I want to chose size 17.5 after choosing a model I like so that I can have a comfortable experience with my bike that fits me well.</li>

				<h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
				<p style="margin-top:0">Before getting into the refinement stage, I developed low-fidelity wireframes, mapping out the user interaction with each design element.</p>
					<img src="images/lofi_compiled.jpg">

				<h4>Feature Organization</h4>
				<p style="margin-top:10px">Optimizing feature organization was challenging but absolutely necessary. Keeping in mind the user stories and how my observed experience was, I came to the solution of designing a table for the various specifications in a bike in an easily comprehensible method.</p>
